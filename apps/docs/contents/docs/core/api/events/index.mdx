description: Learn how to use events in Arrow Navigation and get started with spatial navigation.
---

Arrow Navigation provides a set of events that you can use to listen to navigation changes and handle them in your application. You can use these events to implement custom behavior based on the navigation state.

## Example
  
```ts
import { ArrowNavigationEvents, getArrowNavigation } from '@arrow-navigation/core'

const navigationApi = getArrowNavigation()

const handleCurrentElementChange = (element, direction) => {
  console.log('Current element changed', element, direction)
}

// Add an event listener
navigationApi.on(ArrowNavigationEvents.CURRENT_ELEMENT_CHANGE, handleCurrentElementChange)

// Remove the event listener
navigationApi.off(ArrowNavigationEvents.CURRENT_ELEMENT_CHANGE, handleCurrentElementChange)
```

## Events


The API implements an Event Emitter to listen to events. The events are accessible through the `on` and `off` methods. All the events can be accesed through the `ArrowNavigationEvents` enum.
