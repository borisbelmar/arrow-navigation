# Arrow Navigation Core

Light and zero-dependency module to navigate through elements using the arrow keys written in Typescript.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save @borisbelmar/arrow-navigation

# or

yarn add @borisbelmar/arrow-navigation
```

For the moment, the module is not available in the browser. You need to use a bundler like Webpack or Rollup to use it.
